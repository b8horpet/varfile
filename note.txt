Note to self:
varfile ought to firstly load the file into memory as a datatree, and fetch
data from it further on
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
IDEA: files should be written as:
	foo = bar;
where "foo" is the variable name, and "bar" is its contents, both always read
in as char* semicolons should always signalize the end of expression aka.
expression is terminated by semicolon, not a newline
eg.
	foo
	=bar
	;
is a valid expression
unlike expressions, comments are going to be newline terminated, eg.
	foo //this is a comment
	=bar;
here, "this is a comment" is ignored and not seen as a part of expression
semicolon is non-terminating if it is preceeded by a single quote, eg.
	foo = "bar;"
is an invalid expression, but
	foo = "bar;";
isnt

equation signs and quotes are to be preceeded by a backslash if not part of an
expression: 
	foo = "foo \= \"bar\"";
contents of foo will be precieved as "foo = "bar""

TODO: make the code be less newline and space sensitive
