Note to self:
Currently, the Varfile::set functions are only searching for the position of the word following the string matched as the seeked variable.
Aside from this concept itself needing to be futher debugged, it is highly untrustworthy, since the library always assumes such order, without checking for it
two solutions for that would be to add better syntax rules, of add better checks, namely to help distinguish between float and int values.
