Note to self:
varfile ought to firstly load the file into memory as a datatree, and fetch
data from it further on
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
IDEA: files should be written as:
	foo = bar;
where "foo" is the variable name, and "bar" is its contents, both always read
in as char* semicolons should always signalize the end of expression aka.
expression is terminated by semicolon, not a newline
eg.
	foo
	=bar
	;
is a valid expression
unlike expressions, comments are going to be newline terminated, eg.
	foo //this is a comment
	=bar;
here, "this is a comment" is ignored and not seen as a part of expression
semicolon is non-terminating if it is preceeded by a single quote, eg.
	foo = "bar;"
is an invalid expression, but
	foo = "bar;";
isnt

equation signs and quotes are to be preceeded by a backslash if not part of an
expression: 
	foo = "foo \= \"bar\"";
contents of foo will be precieved as "foo = "bar""
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ok, as it turns out, there is not clean way to have this library depend on
datanode library. one way to overcome this is to have the varfile library only
parse for requested symbols on demand, and have the rest of abstraction process
be done on the frontend of game engine.
